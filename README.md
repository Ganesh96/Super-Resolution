# Super-Resolution

## Introduction
The covid-19 pandemic has made us depend even more on virtual technologies
to keep us going forward with our day to day activities. Even though latest
cameras give high resolution images as output, in many domains due to factors like
network limitations, it is very difficult to obtain high resolution images. But to get
meaningful inference out of the low resolution images we will have to improve the
quality. The goal of the single-image super-resolution algorithms is to generate a
high resolution image from a low-resolution image. In this project, we evaluate
3 different super resolution algorithms namely generative adversarial network for
single image super-resolution (SRGAN), Image Super-Resolution Using Deep
Convolutional Networks (SRCNN) and Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-
Pixel Convolutional Neural Network (ESPCN). We used the Div2k single-image
super-resolution data set that contains 1,000 images with different scenes for our
experiments. The data set was split into 800 for training, 100 for validation and
100 for testing.
